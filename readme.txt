= Shortcodify =
Shortcodify adds some useful Shortcodes to your blog.

Shortcodes are small snippetts use in your textfield / tiny / rte field. In the live version of the page they will be replaced with something different.
One example for a shortcode of this plugin is `[date]` when you use it the tiny, in the live version you can see the actual Date.
But Shortcodify does more.
If you want to, Shortcodify creates a new widget area in, that you can use with the `[widget]` shortcode.

See all (actual) **possible shortcodes** below:
* `[wsc class=myCustomClass]` TEXT `[/wsc]` - for individual CSS-classes
* `[unshortcode]` TEXT `[/unshortcode]` - other shortcodes in this shortcode will be ignored
* `[br]` - adds a linebreak (with clearing)
* `[hr]` - adds a horizontal line
* `[date]` - inserts the actual date
* `[time]` -  inserts the actual time
* `[widget]` - inserts the content of the "Shortcodify" widget area
