Shortcodify adds some useful Shortcodes to your blog.

== Description ==

Shortcodify adds some useful Shortcodes to your blog.

Shortcodes are small snippetts use in your textfield / tiny / rte field. In the live version of the page they will be replaced with something different.
One example for a shortcode of this plugin is `[date]` when you use it the tiny, in the live version you can see the actual Date.
But Shortcodify does more.
If you want to, Shortcodify creates a new widget area in, that you can use with the [widget] shortcode.

See some **possible shortcodes** below:
*  `[wsc class=myCustomClass]` TEXT `[/wsc]` - for individual CSS-classes
*  `[unshortcode]` TEXT `[/unshortcode]` - other shortcodes in this shortcode will be ignored
*  `[br]` - adds a linebreak (with clearing)
*  `[hr]` - adds a horizontal line
*  `[date]` - inserts the actual date
*  `[time]` -  inserts the actual time
*  `[widget]` - inserts the content of the "Shortcodify" widget area
*  `[random]` Text1 Text2 [/random] - returns only one of included areas (seperated by linebreak or whatever)`
*  A few more useful shortcodes
